# qb-auctions
An auctions script that uses an app in my qb-phone to manage, and buy/sell items


### Special Note
This script may or may not be plug-and-play with whatever framework/server you are using. There may be incomplete features, I can't remember what features might be unfinished. I will not be providing support for this. Best of luck.


### Features
 - Post items, from your inventory, for others to bid on and buy
 - Use the app to bid on, or Buy Now, items
 - Pickup the won/bought items from the pawn shop
